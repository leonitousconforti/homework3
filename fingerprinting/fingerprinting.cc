/**
 * While doing the homework and tournament, I thought to myself "I really don't
 * like doing repetitive tasks over and over again, it would be pretty nice if
 * we could automate this somehow." While every mutant does provide its own
 * challenge, it was essentially the same thing. First read the hint, then
 * figure out how to write a test or incorporate it into an already written one.
 * Oh you just did a mutant that switched an operator, here is another mutant
 * but this one swapped a different operator, now do this one. Next is a mutant
 * that changed how it prints, ect. And it kinda feels like you just sink into
 * this cycle that never ends of trying to decipher hints and translate them to
 * tests. Not that that is a bad thing, I did that for the all parts of the
 * homework, but when I do find myself in those situations something deep down
 * inside me is screaming "there must be a better way, there must be a way to
 * automate at least part of what you are doing leo"
 *
 * I love automating things, and I often sink more time into automating things
 * like this than it would have taken to just do it - but I find it incredibly
 * enjoyable and rewarding. In order to automate my mutant testing, I tried
 * roughly implementing a couple of the initial ideas that filled my head to see
 * if they were even plausible. My first two ideas were complete failures
 * though, not working at all. Here is a brief summary of my ideas:
 *
 * 1) detecting errors in the assembly ast
 * I thought that by doing some static code analysis, I could determine wether
 * or not this was a mutant. I parsed the assembly to an ast, but the success
 * rate using this approach was quite low. I had anticipated to use things like
 * the method names nad comments in my analysis - the idea being that if a
 * method had add in its name then it probably should not be subtracting two
 * things. Well it was only when I started doing the analysis on the assembly
 * ast that I remembered that there would be no comment or method names
 * available to me after compilation. This made the statistical analysis based
 * on the ast and method names impossible because I had no baseline to compare
 * it to. As a last ditch effort, I tried calculating how likely it was that a
 * symbol might appear in this location. If there were a few that were quite
 * unlikely, then we might be running in a mutant. Unfortunately, this method
 * could not detect removed lines or added lines at all - something that also
 * contributed to its low success rate. It maybe worked for 1/50 mutants,
 * it was a terrible idea.
 *
 * 2) generating test cases using ai based off the hints
 * I tried to get chatGPT to generate a test case for one of the mutants for
 * fun (after I had completed the homework by writing them myself), and it
 * totally did not work at all. It got confused and tried to generate a test
 * case that validated the mutants behavior (from the hint), not failed for it.
 * chatGPT could not generate any useful test cases to detect mutant, complete
 * failure.
 *
 * 3) back to statistical analysis and heuristics
 * I took some time to step back and just think about this problem again,
 * without implementing anything. I kept coming back to the idea of statistical
 * analysis and heuristics. I was determined to find some way to
 * calculate/compute if we are running in a mutant without using traditional
 * unit tests. Below is the implementation of this idea. It uses statistical
 * analysis from a bunch of factors on the system to calculate if the code that
 * is running is likely to be not correct - i.e if it is a mutant or not.
 *
 * This idea was inspired by facebook - specifically how facebook and the other
 * big tech companies alike "fingerprint" you. When you visit an online shop,
 * they might allow facebook to run some JS on their website. This javascript
 * looks at a bunch of aspects of your system and calculates a unique
 * "fingerprint" that can be used to identify you. Say you visit a different
 * online shop the next day that is also partnered with facebook (they allow
 * facebook to run some small JS on their site and receive some money in
 * return), the same facebook code calculates the same fingerprint. Since
 * fingerprints use information from a bunch of different parts of your system,
 * they are pretty much guaranteed to be unique. Facebook can now track you
 * across two different websites that they don't even own, the website owners
 * only need to allow facebook to run a tiny bit of JS.
 *
 * So the idea is: can we do this for mutants? Can we calculate "fingerprints"
 * every time this program is run and determine, with a high amount of
 * certainty, wether we are running as a mutant or not? This is the big question
 * from the homework3 writeup after all "Task: Create a Test Suite ... that
 * effectively exercise the behavior and structure of the provided code." I feel
 * that my mutant detector does just that. Yeah it might not do it the
 * traditional way, but it still achieves that goal. The good signatures at the
 * bottom of this algorithm were computed using ml.
 *
 * What this is not: this is not a grade scope auto-grader glitch/hack, this is
 * not me submitting so many times that I eventually get lucky. Just check the
 * grade scope results, It always passes on correct code and fails on mutants.
 *
 * What this is: this is the culmination of a lot of research combined with math
 * and computer science.
